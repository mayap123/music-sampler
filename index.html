  <p>BROCKHAMPTON is one of the most creative and unique groups in music today. The boy band/rap collective was formed in Texas by singer Kevin Abstract. Many of the members met each other online through a Kanye West fan site. BROCKHAMPTON is made up of vocalists, producers, graphic designers, photographers and videographers. They even refer to their manager and merchandise creator as a part of the band. The group is very experimental with their music. They released 3 albums alone in 2017, which form the SATURATION trilogy. In 2018, the group signed a record deal with RCA Records. They went from recording music in their bedroom to making their fourth album at the iconic Abbey Road Studios in London. The band is able to successfully connect with fans through personal lyrics about topics such as their sexuality and mental illness. They refer to themselves as "the hardest working boy band," "America's favorite boy band" and "the best boy band since One Direction."
